## About The Project

The inception of this project was driven by a challenge posed by our professor to design an application capable of addressing three primary functionalities: generating random recipes, maintaining a comprehensive grocery list, and seamlessly converting quantities between Metric and Imperial units. Recognizing the practicality and everyday relevance of such an application, my teammate Peter and I embarked on a collaborative journey to create what we now proudly call The Recipe Planner.

Our goal was to develop a tool that not only meets the technical requirements of the assignment but also addresses real-world challenges faced by consumers. From simplifying meal planning to aiding in grocery shopping and accommodating different measurement systems, The Recipe Planner is designed to be a versatile and user-friendly solution for anyone looking to streamline their cooking experience.
