Grill steak about 3- to 4-inches from heat source, for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare and 6 to 7 minutes for medium (grilling time varies with meat thickness). If desired, to create crosshatch marks, turn steak 45 degrees halfway through grilling on each side. Flank steak is best eaten medium-rare and nicely seared on the outside; flank steak cooked beyond medium will be tough. Do NOT overcook!"},

When ready to broil, remove steak from marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and season both sides liberally with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste (pressing seasonings into meat with your fingers). Place flank steak on hot broiling pan, coated with cooking spray. Leave oven door ajar, and broil 6 to 7 minutes on each side for medium-rare, 9 minutes on each side for medium."},

Double check doneness by thermometer (rare - 130 to 140 degrees F, medium-rare - 140 to 150 degrees F, medium - 150 to 160 degrees F), or by touch (very rare feels soft and squishy, rare is soft to the touch, medium-rare yields gently to the touch, while medium yields only slightly to the touch and is beginning to firm up). Cover steak loosely with foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes (five minutes per inch of thickness), allowing meat juices to redistribute and settle. To serve, slice thinly on the bias (at a sharp angle) and across the grain, and arrange on warmed platter or plates."},
